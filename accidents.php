    <p style="text-align: justify;">Road accidents are undoubtedly the most frequent and, overall, the cause of the most damage. The reasons for this are
        the extremely dense road traffic and the relatively great freedom of movement given to drivers. Accidents involving
        heavy goods vehicles (especially coaches and lorries with trailers) occur all too frequently despite caIls for responsible
        behaviour, for respect of the loading regulations and the highway code, as well as the obligation for drivers to
        adapt their speed, which affects stopping distances, to the traffic and weather conditions (rain, ice, fog, etc.).
        The prevention of road accidents is also extremely important and will be ensured by strict laws, by technical and
        police controls, ongoing training for drivers (especially those involved in the transport of dangerous substances)
        and, if need be, by legal and administrative penalties for those responsible.</p>

        <br />
        <strong>When the accident occurs</strong>
        <br /> - Keep calm and avoid panic; to the extent possible, help family and neighbours who are in difficulty.
        <br /> - Follow the captain's (or driver's) orders and those of the crew.
        <br /> - Keep identity papers and important personal documents (medical and vaccination certificates and details of blood
        type) and any personal medicines with you.
        <br /> - As soon as the crash or shipwreck occurs, try to free yourself from the cabin and to escape quickly from the wreckage,
        especially if there is a danger of fire or dangerous leaks. Seek refuge at a sufficient distance.
        <br /> - If possible, activate the rescue process by alerting the local security or specialist services (special telephone
        networks and numbers).
        <br /> - In case of a major accident occurring in a road with traffic, direct the traffic whilst taking care of your own
        safety (signal and mark the accident spot).
        <br /> - Do not touch or move the seriously wounded unless there is a risk of fire or toxic fumes.
        <br /> - It is the duty of witnesses to alert the rescue services and to give them the exact location and nature of the
        accident, the type of vehicle involved, the characteristics (code number) of any dangerous substances and the likely
        number of victims. Witnesses should also give their names and addresses.</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <br />
        <strong>After the accident</strong>
        <br /> - Keep calm and avoid panic.
        <br /> - Follow the instructions of the intervening bodies and of the rescue personnel.
        <br /> - If possible, and if necessary, collaborate with the rescuers and with the judicial authorities and experts in
        charge of the investigation.</p>
