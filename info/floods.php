                    <p>This what actions to take when you receive a flood watch or warning alert from the disasters.lk or from another source for your local area and what to do before, during, and after a flood.</p>
                  
                    <p>Flooding is a temporary overflowing of water onto land that is normally dry. Flooding may happen with only a
                        few inches of water, or it may cover a house to the rooftop. There are many possible causes of floods including
                        heavy rain coastal storms and storm surge, waterway overflow from being blocked with garbage, or overflow  dams, or waste water systems, Flooding can occur slowly over many days or
                        happen very quickly with little or no warning,this is called flash floods.</p>
                  
                    
                    <h2>Basic Safety Tips</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>just turn Around,don't go near water, Don’t Drown!</li>
                        <li>Avoid walking or driving through flood waters.</li>
                        <li>Do not drive over bridges that are over fast moving floodwaters. Floodwaters can scour foundation material
                            from around the footings and make the bridge unstable.</li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Just 6 inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle
                                away.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>If there is a chance of flash flooding, move immediately to higher ground.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>If floodwaters rise around your car but the water is not moving, abandon the car and move to higher ground.
                                Do not leave the car and enter moving water.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Avoid camping or parking along streams, rivers, and creeks during heavy rainfall. These areas can flood quickly
                            and with little warning.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Flood watch</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Flood Watch</strong>
                        <strong>= “Be Aware.”</strong> Conditions are right for flooding to occur in your area.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Steps to Take</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Turn on your TV/radio. You will receive the latest weather updates and emergency instructions.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Know where to go. You may need to reach higher ground quickly and on foot.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Build or restock your emergency preparedness kit. Include a flashlight, batteries, cash, and first aid
                                supplies.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Prepare Your Home</strong>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Bring in outdoor furniture and move important indoor items to the highest possible floor. This will help
                                protect them from flood damage.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Disconnect electrical appliances and do not touch electrical equipment if you are wet or standing in
                                water. You could be electrocuted.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>If instructed, turn off your gas and electricity at the main switch or valve. This helps prevent fires and
                            explosions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Flood warning</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Flood Warning = "Take Action!" </strong>Flooding is either happening or will happen shortly.</p>
                    <p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Move immediately to higher ground or stay on high ground.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Evacuate if directed.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Avoid walking or driving through flood waters. Turn Around, Don’t Drown! Just 6 inches of moving water can

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Be aware of areas where floodwaters have receded and watch out for debris. Floodwaters often erode roads
                                and walkways.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Do not attempt to drive through areas that are still flooded.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Avoid standing water as it may be electrically charged from underground or downed power lines.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Photograph damage to your property for insurance purposes.</li>
                    </ul>
