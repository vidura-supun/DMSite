			<h1>Before a landslide</h1>
			<h2>Minimizing the risks from landslides</h2>
			<p>Landslide risk can be minimized by various methods, including:</p>
			<h3>Avoidance</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>With expert input and careful planning, communities can identify unstable slopes and restrict or control development in hazard zones. </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Protective measures</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>For communities that are already established, the municipal or provincial authorities must consider whether protective engineering measures or buy-outs and moving of people and buildings should be undertaken. </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Engineered solutions</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>If unstable slopes cannot be avoided, there are numerous engineered solutions to deter landslides including:
					<ul>
						<li>improving drainage</li>
						<li>reducing the angle of the slope</li>
						<li>excavating to unload the top of the slope</li>
						<li>building a protective berm or wall to buttress the bottom of the slope</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Containment or diversion structures</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Where landslides can neither be prevented nor avoided, a number of physical containment or diversion structures have been designed, including:
					<ul>
						<li>catchment dams and containment basins to control debris and water</li>
						<li>artificial channels or chutes to redirect debris flow</li>
						<li>nets and artificial walls to prevent falling rock or earth from hitting roads or structures</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2><a id="a3"></a>How to protect your home against landslides</h2>
			<p>Although landslides usually occur without warning, understanding this natural hazard and following some sensible rules can help to protect your family and home.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Learn about your local geology and the potential for landslides in your area.</li>
				<li>Avoid actions that would increase instability. For example, do not undercut a steep bank; do not build near the top or base of steep slopes; do not place fill on steep slopes; do not drain pools or otherwise increase water flow down steep slopes. </li>
				<li>Learn how to recognize signs of potential failure in your locality. Examples include slope cracks, slope bulges, unusual seepage of water on the slope, and small rock or sediment falls.</li>
				<li>Know who to notify if you recognize these signs (e.g. municipal emergency contact numbers and municipal engineers).</li>
			</ul>

            <h1>During a landslide</h1>
			<h2>If indoors</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Find cover in the section of the building that is furthest away from the approaching landslide. </li>
				<li>Take shelter under a strong table or bench. </li>
				<li>Hold on firmly and stay put until all movement has ceased.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>If outdoors</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Move quickly away from its likely path, keeping clear of embankments, trees, power lines and poles. </li>
				<li>Stay away from the landslide. The slope may experience additional failures for hours to days afterwards. </li>
			</ul>
